## About
LFBot is a JavaScript toolkit developed to automate the process of expanding content boxes on "The Linux Foundation" website.
This script was created as part of a training program on 07.06.2023, where it was necessary to manually expand each content box.
This task could be time-consuming and repetitive, leading to decreased efficiency and productivity.

By using LFBot, you can streamline the training process by automatically expanding all content boxes on the page.
This saves valuable time and effort, allowing you to focus more on the training content itself rather than repetitive actions.
The tool utilizes modern web technologies to identify and expand closed boxes, ensuring a seamless experience.

In addition to its core functionality, LFBot is designed with extensibility in mind.
The code can be easily enhanced with additional features, such as automatic screenshots, to further improve its utility.
This enables you to capture screenshots automatically for record-keeping or documentation purposes, providing a comprehensive training resource.

LFBot is an open-source project hosted on GitHub, aiming to empower users with an efficient and automated solution for expanding content boxes during training programs. It serves as a valuable tool for individuals or organizations utilizing "The Linux Foundation" platform for training purposes, optimizing their learning experience and boosting productivity.
